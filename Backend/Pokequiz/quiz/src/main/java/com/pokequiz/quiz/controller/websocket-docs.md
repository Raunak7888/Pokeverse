# PokeQuiz API Documentation

This document outlines the API endpoints for the PokeQuiz application, covering both traditional RESTful interactions and real-time WebSocket (STOMP) communication.

-----

## 1\. WebSocket API Reference

The PokeQuiz application utilizes WebSockets with STOMP for real-time game updates, chat, and answer submissions.

**WebSocket Endpoint:** `ws://localhost:8080/ws` (for development)

Clients should connect to this endpoint and then use STOMP `SUBSCRIBE` and `SEND` frames to interact with the various channels described below.

-----

### 1.1. Inbound Channels (Client to Server - `SEND` to `/app/...`)

These are the destinations where clients can send messages to the server.

#### 1.1.1. Send Chat Message

* **Description:** Allows a player to send a chat message to a specific game room.
* **Destination:** `/app/chat/{roomId}`
* **Method:** `SEND`
* **`roomId` (Path Variable):** The unique ID of the room where the message should be sent.
* **Payload (`Message` DTO - JSON):**
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",   
    "username": "string", 
    "content": "string"  
  }
  ```
* **Example Client Send:**
  ```javascript
  stompClient.send('/app/chat/101', {}, JSON.stringify({
      userId: 'userABC',
      username: 'Ash',
      content: 'Good luck, trainers!'
  }));
  ```
* **Server Behavior:** The server receives this message and broadcasts it to the corresponding outbound chat topic for the room.

#### 1.1.2. Start Game

* **Description:** Initiates the quiz game for a specific room. Typically triggered by the room host.
* **Destination:** `/app/start/{roomId}`
* **Method:** `SEND`
* **`roomId` (Path Variable):** The unique ID of the room where the game should start.
* **Payload:** (Empty or optional simple text)
* **Example Client Send:**
  ```javascript
  stompClient.send('/app/start/101', {}, '');
  ```
* **Server Behavior:** Sets the room's `started` flag to `true` and sends a "Game started" message to `/topic/rooms/{roomId}/game`.

#### 1.1.3. Start Sending Questions

* **Description:** Instructs the server to begin broadcasting quiz questions to the room at a fixed interval. This initiates the question rounds.
* **Destination:** `/app/game/{roomId}/{hostId}`
* **Method:** `SEND`
* **`roomId` (Path Variable):** The unique ID of the room.
* **`hostId` (Path Variable):** The user ID of the room host, used for authorization to prevent non-hosts from starting questions.
* **Payload:** (Empty)
* **Example Client Send:**
  ```javascript
  stompClient.send('/app/game/101/500', {}, '');
  ```
* **Server Behavior:**
    * Initiates a scheduled task (if not already running) to send questions every 30 seconds.
    * Fetches a new, unique question (not previously used in this room) from the `GameService`.
    * Increments the `currentRound` of the room.
    * Saves the `RoomQuiz` entry to track the question's usage in the room.
    * Broadcasts the `GameQuestionDto` to the `/topic/rooms/{roomId}/game` topic.
    * Stops broadcasting if max rounds are reached, no more unique questions are available, or the room is no longer active.

#### 1.1.4. Submit Answer for Validation

* **Description:** Players send their chosen answer for a specific question to the server for validation.
* **Destination:** `/app/game/answer/validation`
* **Method:** `SEND`
* **Payload (`WsAnswerValidationDTO` DTO - JSON):**
  ```json
  {
    "userId": 1,         
    "roomId": 123,         
    "questionId": 456,   
    "answer": "string", 
    "correct": false 
  }
  ```
* **Example Client Send:**
  ```javascript
  stompClient.send('/app/game/answer/validation', {}, JSON.stringify({
      userId: 201,
      roomId: 101,
      questionId: 301,
      answer: 'Pikachu',
      correct: false // Client provides, but server validates
  }));
  ```
* **Server Behavior:**
    * Validates the `roomId`, `questionId`, `userId`, and the `answer` itself (ensuring it's not null/empty).
    * Fetches the correct answer for the question.
    * Determines if the player's submitted answer is correct.
    * Creates and saves a `PlayerAnswer` record.
    * Updates the player's score if the answer was correct (+10 points).
    * Broadcasts the `WsAnswerValidationDTO` (with the server-determined `correct` status) to the `/topic/rooms/{roomId}/game` topic.

-----

### 1.2. Outbound Channels (Server to Client - `SUBSCRIBE` to `/topic/...`)

These are the topics that clients can subscribe to receive real-time updates from the server.

#### 1.2.1. Room Game & General Updates

* **Description:** This is a versatile topic for various game-related updates, including game start/end notifications, new questions, and answer validation results.
* **Destination:** `/topic/rooms/{roomId}/game`
* **Method:** `SUBSCRIBE`
* **`roomId` (Path Variable):** The unique ID of the room to subscribe to.

      }
      ```
    * **Answer Validation Result (`WsAnswerValidationDTO` - JSON):**

      console.log("Received game update:", JSON.parse(message.body));
  });
  ```
